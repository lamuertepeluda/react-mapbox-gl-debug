Getting started:

install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

### Additional Steps

Since this is a fork of [react-mapbox-gl-debug](https://github.com/lamuertepeluda/react-mapbox-gl-debug) which points to [this fork](https://github.com/lamuertepeluda/react-mapbox-gl) of the original [react-mapbox-gl](https://github.com/alex3165/react-mapbox-gl) and **it is not published** on npm, you mus also
```
cd node_modules/react-mapbox-gl
npm i
npm run build
```

All the above steps including initial install have bigger success rate using yarn.

## Run the app
Run the application:

```
npm start
```
